course_type and courses should be easy to populate (similar to the teachers one), but maybe use a CSV file instead of a dictionary (convert csv -> data structures)
room is also easy


for offerings:
- create a data structure that is for every period, there is a set of rooms
- create a DS that is for every period, there is a set of teacher ids
- loop through every course and repeat it xRandom times
- for every loop, select a random period and remove a random room and teacher from each set for each period

the other ones are horrible to do and i will cry
